Figuring out what I can do with git


Pretty sure I know enough of what I am doing now, I will finish this project off now.
Present self, signing off

Future self,
   Hello! I am writing you from the day I decided to figure out Git
   I hope you are having a good day, and that your projects and ambitions are moving along well
   I, personally, will be probably doing some restaurant/retail work this summer, along side figuring out some code
   stuff and building a Git account I can be proud of.
   With admiration,
